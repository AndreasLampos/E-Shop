# Project Title

The eShop Program is a web-based application designed to facilitate online shopping and streamline the management of an e-commerce store. It provides a user-friendly interface for customers to browse and purchase products, while also offering administrative capabilities for store owners to manage inventory, process orders, and track sales.

## Description

Product Catalog: The eShop Program allows you to create and manage a comprehensive product catalog. Each product can have various attributes such as name, description, price, and availability.

Customer Registration: Customers can create accounts to personalize their shopping experience, store their billing and shipping information, and track their order history.

Shopping Cart: The program includes a shopping cart feature that enables customers to add products, update quantities, and proceed to checkout for purchase.

Secure Payment Processing: Integration with popular payment gateways ensures secure and reliable transaction processing. Customers can choose from various payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, or other electronic payment options.

Order Management: The eShop Program provides an intuitive interface for store owners to manage incoming orders, track order status, and generate invoices for customers. It also allows for order cancellation or modification, if necessary.

Inventory Management: Store owners can easily add new products, update quantities, and manage stock levels. Automated notifications can be set up to alert when inventory reaches a certain threshold.

Customer Support: Customers can contact the store's customer support team through integrated messaging or email for inquiries, issues, or product assistance.

Promotions and Discounts: Store owners have the ability to create and apply promotional discounts, coupon codes, or special offers to specific products or for a limited time.
